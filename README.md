This repository is for the Milwaukee Zoo [zooview.tv](https://zooview.tv). Everything is packaged and built with Amazon's Amplify service and served up quickly with RTSP streams. The streaming backend is handled elsewhere so this is just a frontend to display the cameras.

Any camera that supports RTSP streaming can be utilized.
